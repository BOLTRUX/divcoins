		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Testing Framework",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Testing Framework' task into steps covering installation of Jest and React Testing Library, configuration files setup (Babel/TypeScript), creating the initial test setup file, and writing a simple verification test.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard setup task with well-defined steps. Complexity is low as it primarily involves configuration and installation. It can be broken into a few sequential subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Supabase Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Supabase Authentication' task into subtasks for each authentication flow: Sign Up, Login (Password), Login (Social), Logout, Password Reset, Email Verification, and JWT/Session Management. Include subtasks for integrating with the Users table and form validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to the number of distinct authentication flows required (password, social, reset, verify) and the need to handle session management and user profile integration. Each flow is a significant piece of work requiring multiple steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Relationship Management Backend",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Relationship Management Backend' task into subtasks for creating relationships, adding/removing members, handling invitations (generating/validating), assigning/managing roles, configuring RLS, and writing backend tests.",
			"reasoning": "This involves multiple backend operations interacting with the database and implementing business logic (invitations, roles, RLS). It's moderately complex and benefits from breaking down by core functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Relationship Management Frontend",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Relationship Management Frontend' task into subtasks for building UI components for creating groups, joining groups, viewing group details, managing members (add/remove/roles), implementing the invitation UI flow, and integrating with backend services.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires building several distinct UI components and pages, integrating with the backend, and handling different user roles. Breaking it down by component/flow makes it manageable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Expense Management Backend",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Expense Management Backend' task into subtasks for creating expense entries, implementing automatic splitting logic (equal, percentage), implementing custom splitting logic, handling expense categories, implementing receipt upload to storage, configuring RLS, and writing backend tests.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex backend task involving multiple data models (expenses, splits), different splitting algorithms, file storage integration, and RLS. Breaking it down by functionality and splitting type is crucial."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Expense Management Frontend",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Expense Management Frontend' task into subtasks for building the 'Add Expense' form (including splitting options and receipt upload), the 'Expense List' component (with filtering/search), the 'Expense Details' component, integrating with backend services, and implementing form validation.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the backend, the frontend for expense management is complex due to the detailed 'Add Expense' form with various splitting options and receipt upload, plus the list and detail views. Breaking down by component and key features is necessary."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Debt Calculation Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Debt Calculation Logic' task into subtasks for designing the calculation algorithm, implementing the core logic (querying/processing data), optimizing settlements (optional but good), and writing comprehensive unit/integration tests for the logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves developing a specific algorithm to process financial data, which can be mathematically complex, especially if optimization is included. Breaking it down into design, implementation, and testing phases is appropriate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Dashboard Backend Data Aggregation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Build Dashboard Backend Data Aggregation' task into subtasks for aggregating expense summaries (by category/time), fetching current debt/credit statuses, preparing data for charts/reports, and writing backend tests for aggregation services.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves querying and summarizing existing data. While not as complex as core feature logic, it requires careful data handling and structuring. Breaking down by the type of data being aggregated is helpful."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build Dashboard Frontend UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Build Dashboard Frontend UI' task into subtasks for creating the main dashboard layout, building the expense summary widget, building the debt status widget, building the recent activity feed widget, integrating with backend data services, and ensuring theme compatibility.",
			"reasoning": "This involves building a composite UI from multiple widgets and integrating data. It's moderately complex due to the layout and data integration. Breaking down by widget and core functionality is suitable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Global Error Handling and Loading States",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Global Error Handling and Loading States' task into subtasks for setting up global error boundaries, implementing consistent loading indicators (spinners/skeletons), implementing user-friendly error message display (toasts/pages), integrating with React Query states, and testing across different application areas.",
			"reasoning": "This is a cross-cutting concern affecting multiple parts of the application. It requires implementing different patterns (error boundaries, loading states, notifications) and ensuring consistency. It's moderately complex due to its pervasive nature."
