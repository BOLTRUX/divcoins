# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Dashboard Frontend UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the frontend UI for the main Dashboard. This includes creating the responsive layout and implementing widgets to display expense summaries, debt calculation results, and recent activity feed, integrating with the theme system.
# Details:
Create React components for the Dashboard layout and individual widgets (e.g., 'Expense Summary Card', 'Debt Status Widget', 'Recent Activity List'). Fetch aggregated data from the backend services (Task 8). Ensure all components are themeable using the existing OKLCH theme system. Implement basic chart display for summaries if required by the layout.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test the dashboard layout and widgets on different screen sizes. Verify that data fetched from the backend is displayed correctly. Test theme switching on the dashboard components. Write integration tests for dashboard data fetching and rendering.
