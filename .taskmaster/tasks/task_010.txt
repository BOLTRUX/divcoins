# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Global Error Handling and Loading States
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 6, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a consistent system for handling errors and displaying loading states across the application, particularly for asynchronous operations like API calls and data fetching.
# Details:
Utilize React Query's built-in loading and error states. Implement global error boundaries for catching rendering errors. Create user-friendly error messages and display them appropriately (e.g., toast notifications, error pages). Implement loading indicators (spinners, skeletons) for data fetching and form submissions. Ensure a consistent user experience for async operations.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test various scenarios that trigger loading states (e.g., slow network) and errors (e.g., invalid input, backend failure) across the implemented features (Auth, Relationships, Expenses, Dashboard). Verify that loading indicators are shown and error messages are user-friendly and informative. Write integration tests to simulate API errors and verify error handling.
